# fullJourney Access the website at : https://aesthetic-chebakia-c2a6ac.netlify.app/ [P.S : wait for a while I am using free version of render, let the server start......XD]
FullJourney is a free to use AI image generator which uses bing Image generater (Dall-E indirectly) at the backend to deliver 4 high resolution images for any text prompt.
The application is still in development phase and currently you can save your generated image to a community page. Meaning your saved images are visible on homepage to anyone who uses.

Future scope is to implement login features to facilitate private storage spaces for every user.

You can create UNLIMITED images unlike midJourney and Dall-E.
This application uses bing cookie(thanks to **nociza** : https://github.com/nociza/Bimg for finding a way to connect to bing).
